# RPG Maker MZ Final Fantasy 9-like Game

Create Final Fantasy 9 like game using RPGMakerMZ

## Plugin order

Code has been separated into different plugins for personal readability, but I have not put much thought into
treating/testing them as discrete plugins.

The order I have tested them in is:

py06pd_Utils
py06pd_SupportSkills
py06pd_EquipLearnSkill
py06pd_FF9BattleMechanics
py06pd_FF9Steal
py06pd_FF9Formation
py06pd_LimitBreak
py06pd_FF9Eat

## Progress

 * Actor data
 * Armor data
 * Class data
 * Item data
 * Skill data
 * Status data incl. support skills
 * Weapon data
 * FF9 attack strength
 * Battle front/back row
 * Equip support abilities
 * Learn skills from gear
 * Steal command
 * Eat command
 * Limit break  - FF7 or FF10 style limit breaks/overdrive rather than ff9 trance

## Todo (not comprehensive)

 * FF9 battle speed
 * Card game - FF8 Triple Triad; not Tetra Master
 * ? and ! interaction prompts
 * Fix status data effects
